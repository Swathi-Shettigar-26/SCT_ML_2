# K-Means Customer Segmentation

This project implements the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters so that marketing strategies can be better targeted.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used contains the following features:

- **CustomerID** â€“ Unique identifier for each customer  
- **Gender** â€“ Male or Female  
- **Age** â€“ Age of the customer  
- **Annual Income (k$)** â€“ Customerâ€™s yearly income (in thousands of dollars)  
- **Spending Score (1-100)** â€“ A score that represents how much the customer spends (higher means more spending)

## ðŸ”§ Features and Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Dropping unnecessary columns  
   - Encoding categorical features like Gender  
   - Scaling features for better clustering

2. **Finding the optimal number of clusters**  
   - Using the **Elbow Method** to visually determine the best cluster count

3. **Applying K-Means Clustering**  
   - Segmenting customers into clusters based on their spending patterns

4. **Visualization**  
   - Plotting graphs to represent customer segments  
   - Helping identify groups for marketing campaigns

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

#The script will generate:

An Elbow plot to help decide the number of clusters

A scatter plot showing customer segments by income and spending score
#Insights

This clustering model can help businesses:

Understand customer behavior

Target specific groups for promotions

Improve customer satisfaction and sales
